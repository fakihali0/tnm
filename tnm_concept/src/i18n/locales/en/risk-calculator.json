      {
        "q": "What is the recommended risk per trade?",
        "a": "Professional traders typically risk 1-2% of their account balance per trade. This ensures you can survive a losing streak without blowing your account."
      },
      {
        "q": "How is pip value calculated?",
        "a": "Pip value varies by instrument. For forex, it's based on contract size and leverage. For indices, it's based on the point value. Our calculator handles this automatically."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is a good Risk:Reward ratio?",
        "a": "A minimum 1:2 ratio is recommended. This means for every $1 you risk, you aim to make $2. This allows you to be profitable even with a 40% win rate."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I use this for crypto trading?",
        "a": "Yes! The calculator supports Forex, Indices, Commodities, and Cryptocurrencies with accurate calculations for each asset class."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do I need to create an account?",
        "a": "No! The risk calculator is 100% free and requires no sign-up. Just start calculating immediately."
      },
      {
        "q": "How accurate are the margin calculations?",
        "a": "Our margin calculations are based on industry-standard formulas and are highly accurate for most brokers. Always verify with your specific broker's margin requirements."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's the difference between the two calculator modes?",
        "a": "Risk Assessment mode evaluates an existing position. Position Sizing mode tells you the optimal lot size based on your risk tolerance."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I save my calculations?",
        "a": "Currently, calculations are session-based. You can export results to PDF or copy to clipboard for your records."
