# Project Overview
- TNM AI is a Supabase-backed trading platform that combines a marketing site with an authenticated "TNM Pro" workspace featuring AI chat, market insights, trading journal tools, and portfolio analytics. The React app drives both the public landing experience and the gated pro dashboard that loads data, alerts, and chat utilities once the user authenticates.
- Frontend stack: Vite + React + TypeScript, React Router, Zustand stores, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS + custom spacing tokens, Framer Motion for animation, i18next for localization/RTL, Sonner for toasts, Recharts/Embla/etc. `@` path alias resolves to `src/` via tsconfig.
- Offline/PWA + performance tooling: vite-plugin-pwa with `src/pwa-setup.ts`, IndexedDB helpers in `src/utils/offline-storage.ts`, request caching (`src/utils/request-cache.ts`), enhanced offline queue, lazy-loaded heavy panels, and a PWA install prompt manager mounted from `main.tsx`.
- Backend integration: `src/integrations/supabase` instantiates the Supabase client used by Zustand stores, hooks, and services. The `supabase/functions` directory contains edge functions (MT4/MT5 connectors, shared rate limiter, etc.) plus SQL migrations that enforce RLS, audit trails, and rate limiting.
- Source layout: `src/pages` (marketing + TNM Pro routes), `src/components` (layout/home/tnm-pro/pwa/error/ui primitives), `src/hooks`, `src/store` (auth, chat), `src/services` and `src/utils` for API helpers/background workers, `src/styles` for tokens, `src/i18n` for resource loaders, `src/data`/`assets` for fixtures. Scripts for bundle analysis live in `scripts/`, and numerous audit/status docs are stored in the repo root.
- Environment requirements: `.env` expects `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; production deployments must mirror the CSP/security headers defined in `index.html` and the README.
