# Task Completion Checklist
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` (Vitest) from `tnm_concept/` whenever frontend code changes.
- For build-impacting work, run `npm run build` to verify Vite bundle succeeds.
- Update sprint/story docs in `docs/` (stories, sprint-status.yaml) when Scrum workflows require it, ensuring citations to PRD/architecture docs.
- Document notable implementation notes in the relevant story's Dev Notes or completion summaries.
- Commit with descriptive messages referencing story IDs; coordinate with BMAD workflows for readiness status.
