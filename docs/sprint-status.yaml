# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# - Epic 1 (Foundation): Nearly complete, only 1-5 (ngrok) and 1-8 (e2e testing) remaining
# - Epic 2 (Core MT5): Fully complete with connection manager, data retrieval, transformers, caching
# - Epic 3 (REST API): Fully complete with all 7 endpoints (auth, connect, info, positions, history, sync, health)
# - Epic 4 (Supabase): 2/5 complete - edge functions refactored, need DB migrations and RLS
# - Story 4-3 (Database schema) is next priority - required for edge functions to work
# - Total test coverage: 195 passing tests for Python MT5 service
# - All completed stories have comprehensive documentation and summaries
